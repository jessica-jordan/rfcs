# Handlebars Strict Mode

## Summary

In this RFC, we propose a set of changes to Ember's variant of Handlebars that
are aimed at improving clarity and simplifying the language. Together, these
changes are bundled into a "strict mode" that developers can opt-into. In
contrast, the non-strict mode (i.e. what developers are using today) will be
referred to as "sloppy mode" in this RFC.

## Motivation

Ember has been using Handlebars since it was released 7 years ago (!). Over
time, we have evloved, adapted and in some case repurposed the Handlebars
language significantly (remember "context-shifting" `{{#each}}`?). This RFC
propose to provide a "strict mode" opt-in to remedy some of Handlebars' design
decisions that we have come to regret over the years, or are otherwise not a
good fit for Ember. We believe this will make the Handlbars language easier to
learn, understand and implement, as well as enable better tooling to support
common development workflows for Ember developers.

We propose the following changes:

1. No implicit globals
2. No implicit `this` fallback
3. No dynamic resolution
4. No evals (no partials)

### 1. No implicit globals

Today, Ember implicitly introduce a set of implicit globals into a template's
scope, such as built-in helpers, components, modifiers. Apps and addons also
have the ability to introduce additional implicit globals by placing files into
the `app` folder or broccoli tree. It is also possible to further influence
this behavior by using the intimate resolver API (such as the alternative
"pods" layout).

This adds a fair amount of dynamism, ambiguity and confusion when reading
templates. When an identifier is encountered, it's not always clear where this
value comes from or what kind of value it may be. This problem is especially
acute for the "ambigious content" position, i.e. `<div>{{foo-bar}}</div>`,
which could be a local variable `foo-bar`, a global component or a helper named
`foo-bar` provided by the app or an addon, or `{{this.foo-bar}}` (see the next
section). This problem is even worse when there is a custom resolver involved,
as the resolver may return a component or helper not found in the "expected"
location at runtime.

Not only is this confusing for the human reader, it also makes it difficult for
the Glimmer VM implementation as well as other ecosystem tooling. For example,
if the developer made a typo, `{{food-bar}}`, it would be impossible to issue
a static error (build time error, inline error in IDEs) because the value may
be resolvable at runtime. It is also difficult, and in some cases impossible,
to implement IDE features such as "Jump to definition" without running code.

[RFC #432](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/contextual-helpers/text/0432-contextual-helpers.md#relationship-with-globals)
described some additional issues with the current implicit globals semantics.

We propose to remove support for implicit globals in strict mode. All values
must be explicitly brought into scope, either through block params or defined
in the "ambient scope" (see [Detailed design](#detailed-design) section).

### 2. No implicit `this` fallback

Today, when Ember sees a path like `{{foo}}` in the template, after exhausting
the possibilities of implicit globals, it falls back to `{{this.foo}}`. This
adds to the same confusion outlined above. More details about the motivation
can be found in the accepted [RFC #308](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/308).

We propose to remove support for implicit `this` fallback in strict mode. The
explicit form `{{this.foo}}` must be used to refer to instance state, otherwise
it will trigger the same errors mentioned in the previous section.

It is worth mentioning that [RFC #432](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/432)
laid out a transition path towards a world where "everything is a value".
Between this and the previous restriction, we essentially have completed that
transition. To recap, here is a list of the
[outstanding issues](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/contextual-helpers/text/0432-contextual-helpers.md#relationship-with-globals):

1. Not possible to reference globals outside of invocation positions
2. Invocation of global helpers in angle bracket named arguments positions
3. Naming collisions between global components, helpers and element modifiers

All of these problems are all related to implicit globals and/or implicit
`this` fallback. Since neither of these features are supported in strict mode,
they are no longer a concern for us.

### 3. No dynamic resolution

Today, Ember supports passing strings to the `component` helper (as well as the
`helper` and `modifier` helpers proposed in [RFC #432](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/432)).
This can either be passed as a literal `{{component "foo-bar"}}` or passed as a
runtime value `{{component this.someString}}`. In either case, Ember will
attempt to _resolve_ the string as a component.

It shares some of the same problems with implicit globals (where did this come
from?), but the dynamic form makes the problem more acute, as it is difficult
or impossible to tell which components a given template is dependent on. As
usual, if it is difficult for the human reader, the same is true for tools as
well. Specifically, this is hostile to "tree shaking" and other forms of static
(build time) dependency-graph analysis, since the dynamic form of the component
helper can invoke _any_ component available to the app.

We propose to remove support for these forms of dynamic resolutions in strict
mode. Specifically, passing a string to the `component` helper (as well as the
`helper` and `modifier` helpers), whether as a literal or at runtime, will
result in an error.

In practice, it is almost always the case that these dynamic resolutions are
switching between a small and bounded number of known components. For this
purpose, they can be replaced by patterns similar to this (using syntax from
the [template imports RFC](todo://template-imports-rfc/)):

```hbs
---
import { eq, get, hash } from '@ember/template/helpers';
import { First, Second, Third } form './contextual-components';
---

{{#if (eq this.selected "first")}}
  {{yield First}}
{{else if (eq this.selected "second")}}
  {{yield Second}}
{{else if (eq this.selected "third")}}
  {{yield Third}}
{{/if}}

{{!-- alternatively... --}}

{{#let (hash first=First second=Second third=Third) as |options|}}
  {{yield (get options this.selected)}}
{{/let}}
```

This will both make it clear to the human reader and enables tools to perform
optimizations, such as tree-shaking, by following the explict dependency graph.

### 4. No evals (no partials)

Ember current supports the `partial` feature. It takes a template name, which
can either be passed as a literal `{{partial "foo-bar"}}` or passed as a
runtime value `{{partial this.someString}}`. In either case, Ember will resolve
the template with the given name (with a prefix dash, like `-foo-bar.hbs`) and
render its content _as if_ they were copy and pasted into the same position.

In either case, the rendered partials have full access to anything that is "in
scope" in the original template. This includes any local variables, instance
variables (via implicit `this` fallback or explicitly), implicit globals, named
arguments, blocks, etc.

This feature has all of the same problems as above, but worse. In addition to
the usual sources (globals, `this` fallback etc), each variable found in a
partial template could also be coming from the "outer scope" from the caller
template. Conversely, on the caller side, "unused" variables may not be safe
to refactor away, because they may be consumed in a nested partial template.

Not only do these make it difficult for humans to follow, the same is true for
tools as well. For example, linters cannot provide accurate undefined/unused
variables warning. Whenever the Glimmer VM encounter partials, it has to emit
a large amount of extra metadata just so they can be "wired up" correctly at
runtime.

We propose to remove support for partials completely in strict mode. Invoking
the `{{partial ...}}` keyword in strict mode will be a static (build time)
error.

The use case of extracting pieces of a template into smaller chunks can be
replaced by [template-only components](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/278).
While this requires any variables to be passed explicitly as arguments, it also
removes the ambiguity and confusions.

It should also be mentioned that the `{{debugger}}` keyword also falls into the
category of "eval" in today's implementation, since it will be able to access
any variable available to the current scope, including `this` fallback and when
nested inside a partial template. However, with the other changes proposed in
this RFC, we will be able to statically determine which variables the debugger
will have access to. Therefore we would still be able to support debugger usage
in strict mode without a very high performance penalty.

## Detailed design

This RFC aim to introduce and define the semantics of the Handlebars strict
mode, as well as the low-level primitive APIs to enable it. However, it does
not introduce any new user-facing syntax or conveniences for opting into this
mode.

The intention is that primary way for users to opt-in to strict mode will be
defined by the [template imports](todo://template-imports-rfc/) proposal using
the APIs proposed in this RFC. However, these low-level APIs will also enable
other build tools (such as [ember-cli-htmlbars-inline-precompile](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-htmlbars-inline-precompile))
to provide their own API for users to opt-in. In addition, these APIs will
allow other experiments to be built in userland, such as explorations for a
"single-file component" format.

### Low-level APIs

We propose to add an option to Ember's template compiler to enable strict mode
compilation.

There three primitive APIs involved in compiling Ember templates.

The `precompile` function (a.k.a. [`precompileTemplate`](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-rfc176-data))
is responsible for taking a template string, running AST plugins, checking for
errors and returning the "wire format" representation of the template. The
exact details of this "wire format" is unspecified and changes from time to
time across minor Ember versions. The only guarentee is that it returns a
string whose content is a valid JavaScript expression.

For example:

```js
import { precompileTemplate } from '@ember/template-compilation';

precompileTemplate('Hello, {{name}}!', {
  moduleName: 'hello.hbs'
}); /* => `{
  "id": "AoL2bkKU",
  "block": "{\"statements\":[\"...\"]}",
  "meta": {"moduleName":"hello.hbs"}
}` */
```

Again, the exact wire format changes from time to time, but the key is that the
content is valid JavaScript. This allows build tools to take this output and
insert in into any context where JavaScript expressions are allowed.

At runtime, the "wire format" can be "rehydrated" into something consumable by
Ember via the `template` function (a.k.a. [`createTemplateFactory`](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-rfc176-data)).

Build tools typically compile templates into JavaScript modules by combining
these two pieces. In our example, the `hello.hbs` template is typically
compiled into a module similar to this:

```js
import { createTemplateFactory } from '@ember/template-factory';

export default createTemplateFactory({
  "id": "AoL2bkKU",
  "block": "{\"statements\":[\"...\"]}",
  "meta": { "moduleName": "hello.hbs" }
});
```

Finally, the `compile` function (a.k.a. [`compileTemplate`](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-rfc176-data))
is a convenience helper that simply combines the two steps by taking a raw
template string and returning a ready-to-be-consumed template object (the
output of `createTemplateFactory`), instead of the wire format. This is
mostly used for compiling templates at runtime, which is pretty rare.

We propose to introduce a new `strict` option to the `precompile` and `compile`
functions to enable strict mode compilation:

```js
import { precompileTemplate } from '@ember/template-compilation';

precompileTemplate('Hello, {{name}}!', {
  moduleName: 'hello.hbs',
  strict: true
});
```

### The ambient scope

Since there are no implicit globals in strict mode, there has to be an
alternative mechanism to introduce helpers and components into scope.

Whenever the strict mode compiler encounters an undefined reference, i.e. an
identifier that is not a currently in-scope local variable (block param), the
default behavior is to assume that these are references to variables in the
_ambient scope_. That is, the compiler will emit JavaScript code that contains
JavaScript references to these variables.

For example, consider the following template:

```hbs
{{#let this.session.currentUser as |user|}}
  <BlogPost @title={{titleize @model.title}} @body={{@model.body}} @author={{user}} />
{{/let}}
```

Here, `this.session.currentUser` is an explicit refernce to the component's
instance state, `user` is a local variable introduced by the `#let` helper,
`@model` is a reference to a named argument. They all have obvious semantics.

On the other hand, `BlogPost` and `titleize` are undefined references. The
compiler will assume that they are defined in the surrounding _ambient scope_
at runtime and produce an output like this:

```js
import { precompileTemplate } from '@ember/template-compilation';

precompileTemplate(`{{#let this.session.currentUser as |user|}}
  <BlogPost @title={{titleize @model.title}} @body={{@model.body}} @author={{user}} />
{{/let}}`, {
  moduleName: 'index.hbs',
  strict: true
}); /* => `{
  "id": "ANJ73B7b",
  "block": "{\"statements\":[\"...\"]}",
  "meta": { "moduleName": "index.hbs" },
  "scope": () => [BlogPost, titleize]
}` */
```

Again, the specific format here is unimportant and subject to change. The key
here is that the JavaScript code  produced by the compiler contains references
(via the `scope` closure in this hypothetical compilation) to the JavaScript
variables `BlogPost` and `titleize` in the surrounding JavaScript scope.

The build tool is responsible for "linking" these undefined references by
putting the compiled JavaScript code inside a JavaScirpt context where these
variables are defined. Otherwise, depending on the configuration, the undefined
references will either cause a static (build-time) error from the linter,
transpiler (e.g. babel) or packager (e.g. rollup or webpack), or a runtime
`ReferenceError` when the code is evaluated by a JavaScript engine.

This low-level, primitive feature is mainly useful for building the user-facing
[template imports](todo://template-imports-rfc/) feature. The user would likely
write a template like this:

```hbs
---
import { titleize } from '@ember/template-helpers';
import BlogPost from './components/blog-post';
---

{{#let this.session.currentUser as |user|}}
  <BlogPost @title={{titleize @model.title}} @body={{@model.body}} @author={{user}} />
{{/let}}
```

The build tool can then compile this into a JavaScript module like this:

```js
import { createTemplateFactory } from '@ember/template-factory';
import { titleize } from '@ember/template-helpers';
import BlogPost from './components/blog-post';

export default createTemplateFactory({
  "id": "ANJ73B7b",
  "block": "{\"statements\":[\"...\"]}",
  "meta": { "moduleName": "index.hbs" },
  "scope": () => [BlogPost, titleize]
});
```

When this is evaulated by a JavaScript engine, the references in the `scope`
closure will automatically be "linked up" with the imports, and Ember will be
able reference these values when rendering the template. Note that these
references are _static_– the values are essentially "snapshotted" by the
rendering engine whenever the template is instantiated. Updates to these values
in the JavaScript scope will _not_ be observable by the rendering engine, even
in conjunction with `Ember.set` or `@tracked`.

Optionally, the build tool can choose to restrict the set of allowed ambient
references by suppling an array of available identifiers to the compiler:

```js
import { precompileTemplate } from '@ember/template-compilation';

precompileTemplate(`{{#let this.session.currentUser as |user|}}
  <BlogPost @title={{titleize @model.title}} @body={{@model.body}} @author={{user}} />
{{/let}}`, {
  moduleName: 'index.hbs',
  strict: true,
  scope: ['BlogPost', 'titleize']
});
```

If the template compiler encounters any undefined references outside of this
allowed list, it will throw an error with the appropiate location info. It also
follows that build tools can choose to disable this feature completely by
passing an empty array.

### Deprecations

Implicit `this` fallback and partials should be deprecated in sloppy mode.

## How we teach this

Strict mode is intended to become the main way Ember developers author
templates going forward. We anticipate this is going to be a slow transition,
but once the majority of Ember developers have migrated, we expect them to find
it clearer, more intuitive and more productive.

Two of the strict mode restrictions – no implicit `this` fallback and no eval,
can be incrementally adopted in sloppy mode templates. The former is already
covered by [RFC #432](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/432). We should
continue implementing the transition path laid out by that RFC and encourage
developers to start adopting the explicit `this` style. The latter (partials)
should also phased out and deprecated as soon as possible, as suggested in
[Pre-RFC #390](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/issues/390). We should encourage
developers to transition to components for these use cases.

On the other hand, implicit globals and dynamic resolutions are not going away
anytime soon in sloppy mode. These features are intrinsically tied to sloppy
mode, and we expect developers to migrate to template imports over time (which
would also opt them into strict mode).

The guides should be updated to feature template imports and therefore strict
mode. This will be discussed in more details in its own RFC.

As for the low-level APIs, we should update the API documentation to cover the
new flags (`strict` and `scope`). The documentation should cover the details of
the "ambient scope" feature discussed in this RFC, and emphasize that it is
intended for linking static values such as helpers and components.
